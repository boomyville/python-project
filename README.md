### Python Project
Some projects made in Python.

Part of my learning journey in becoming a cloud practitioner.

# Guestbook
A simple guestbook using Flask. Users can leave a 'note' in the guestbook. Hooks up to an external MariaDB database. My first python project

# Wordle clone
A wordle clone to be run in the command line interface. Supports 'endless' mode and uses "British English".
